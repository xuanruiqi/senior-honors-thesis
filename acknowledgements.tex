First of all, I must thank my advisor and thesis supervisor, Professor Sam Guyer, for his support. On a winter day,
I walked into his office and asked if he had research projects; Sam was kind enough to offer me many
potential projects. After a few steers, now here we are.  I shall also thank Professor Kathleen Fisher,
who, as a member of my thesis committee, the CS department chair, my programming languages (COMP 105) professor,
and a mentor of mine, was always helpful and caring. I need to also thank Dr. Michael Shah, now
a lecturer at Northeastern University, who was once a marvelous teaching assistant who connected me with Sam;
without him, I might not have been here at all. Finally, I must also thank Karl Cronburg, Raoul Veroy, Moses Huang,
Diogenes Nunez, Jared Chandler, Brian LaChance, Matt Ahrens, and Jeanne-Marie Musca for their assistance and support.
Two fellow undergraduates, Jeremy Colebrook-Soucie and Matt Jones worked with me on a different but closely related
project, ``JumboViz'' (as I call it), and their work on that project also proved to be helpful for the ET2 research
I am doing.

I must also thank my external collaborators who helped me on this project. I owe a lot to Luis Mastrangelo, who, as the author of the
JNIF library, provided us generous help and helped us debug our code. Kathryn McKinley and the DaCapo project group at Google also helped
with the Java version of ET2. Ben Gamari helped with the Haskell version of ET2. Without them, it would be difficult for me
to carry out my research.

Of course, there are many others whom I must thank. Without Professor Mark Sheldon, I wouldn't
have gone this far in computer science, and especially not in programming languages. Other faculty
in the computer science department, such as Professor Norman Ramsey, Professor Noah Mendelsohn, Professor Ming Chow, and the
much beloved Professor Ben Hescott, have also supported me as an undergraduate at Tufts. Finally, I shall not neglect to
thank the staff of the computer science department, who have always been helpful. Many, many more people supported me
during the course of this project and during my entire undergraduate career, but due to space limitations I could not possibly
list all of them here, so I'd like to apologize sincerely to all of those whom I have neglected to thank above.
