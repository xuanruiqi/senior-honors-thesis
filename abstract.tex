This thesis presents a new tool for memory tracing, Elephant Tracks II. Elephant Tracks II (or ET2) is a portable, modular and
extensible memory tracing tool designed for practical memory tracing of garbage-collected programs, producing precise traces of the
program's heap operations, including allocation, pointer mutation, procedure entry \& exit, and object deaths, using the Merlin algorithm
\citep{Merlin} to compute death times. Unlike all previous tools, however, ET2 is capable to support multiple programming languages by
decoupling the tracing phase and the death time computation phase. We describe the high-level design and low-level implementation
strategies employed to support this extensibility and portability. In this thesis, we also present new algorithms and implementation
techniques developed as part of the Elephant Tracks II project, as well as an overview of the applications of memory tracing.
